 2. SAVE - Where you save for later access <DMS>

Both LOAD and SAVE pages use unique folders.

This means the Load page can be viewing a different folder
from the SAVE page!

FILENAMES on disk in RH drive are shown; up to 60 files may be
seen at once.
Displayed for each file are a FILENAME, SUFFIX> and file NUMBER.

FILENAMES consist of 1-8 letters or numbers;
the first of which must be a letter.
A 2-letter FILE SUFFIX indicates the TYPE of file.
Files with different suffixes may
have the same name, but no two files on a disk will be allowed
to have the same name AND suffix.
