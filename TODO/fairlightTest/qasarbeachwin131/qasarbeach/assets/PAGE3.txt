The VOICE EDIT page is where you can create, extend, copy,
paste and make mono into stereo and split stereo to mono.

It is NOT a place where you edit - that would be @jePAGE 6@je

To select a VOICE:

  2. <esc> COMMAND: Vn
               where n: is the VOICE number 1-9 / a-h
               
  3. Click the VOICE: text (top right of the interface)

#3
@uTO ASSIGN A VOICE NAME@u

  1. select the VOICE you want to change the name. The name
     should appear just below the WAVEFORM display (between
     the CREATE and COPY buttons)

  2. Click the VOICE name (between to CREATE and COPY
     buttons). The COMMAND line will become active with the
     NAME command already entered for you.
     type in a new name and press <return>

  3. <esc> and type:
     NAME <filename><enter>
     where <filename is the new name for the VOICE

  This simply changes the name of the voice AS LOADED - and
  has nothing to do with the VOICE FILENAME on disk (which
  may be changed on @j2PAGE 2@j2).
