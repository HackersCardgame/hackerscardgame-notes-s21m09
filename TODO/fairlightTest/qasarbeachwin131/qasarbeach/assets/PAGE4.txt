@uPROFILE GRAPH@u

THE PROFILE GRAPH allows changing parameters to be
specified with the mouse as PROFILES.

The vertical scale represents AMPLITUDE (log); and the
horizontal represents TIME as WAVEFORM SEGMENTS.


@uHARMONIC AMPLITUDE @u

HARMONIC AMPLITUDE profiles provide control of the relative
amplitudes of 32 harmonics. These are mathematically
processed by the principle of ADDITIVE synthesis.

Any loaded VOICE may be chosen for display or modification.

The MODE of the selected voice determines some important
aspects of the profile graph and PAGE 4 in general.

When VOICE is in:

  MODE 1   - Each horizontal division represents 1
             waveform segment. There are 32 segments
           
  MODE 2/4 - Each horizontal division represents 1
             waveform segment. There are 128 segments
#3
@uDURATION PROFILE@u

This is only available when a VOICE is in MODE 1!
The DURATION profile sets time-duration of each segment.

@uVOLUME PROFILE@u
The VOLUME profile controls how loud a VOICE is sounding
for that segment.
Click to activate it then draw a new VOLUME profile.

DO NOT use on MODE 4 voices as it will destroy them!


@uSMOOTH PROFILE@u
The SMOOTH profile controls how much SMOOTHING is applied
to the harmonics for that segment.
Click to activate it then draw a new SMOOTH profile.

DO NOT use on MODE 4 voices as it will destroy them!


@uROUGH PROFILE@u
The ROUGH profile controls how much noise to add to a VOICE
for that segment.
Click to activate it then draw a new ROUGH profile.

DO NOT use on MODE 4 voices as it will destroy them!

@uHARMONIC AMPLITUDE PROFILES@u

THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDE PROFILES are represented by the
numbers 1-32 displayed across the screen. These numbers are
switches to display each profile. If desired, all 32
profiles may be displayed on the graph simultaneously for
viewing. However, more than about 10 at once usually looks
confusing. This means that it is possible for profiles to
be un-displayed and yet still remain ACTIVE (contributing
to the sound). For this reason, two indicators are located
under each harmonic number to show the status.

  (triangle) - profile has NON-ZERO value
  (circle)   - profile is being shown on screen

TO DISPLAY/OPEN a HARMONIC PROFILE click the desired number.
The profile will be DISPLAYED (if not already) and a BOX
will appear around the harmonic number. The the profile
graph will also show it with a heavy outline.

TO DISPLAY/SELECT a BLOCK of 8 HARMONIC profiles touch one
of the BLOCK SELECTOR boxes centred under each group of 8
harmonic numbers. This will DISPLAY the 8 profiles on the
graph.
#5
@uLOOPING VOICES@u

To create a loop in a MODE 1 or MODE 4 waveform. You need
to do the following:

  1. Click the LOOP button or Type:
     LOOP - into the COMMAND:
     
  2. On the PROFILE display Click the start of the LOOP and
     then drag and release the mouse where the end will be.
     This can be infront or behind where you first clicked!
     
  The loop should now be shown underneath the PROFILE
  display. Looping will be turned on. See xxx for more

You can also use the following COMMANDS:
  LPS,<start segment> - to set the LOOP start point
  LPE,<end segment>   - to set the LOOP end point
  LPX,<segments> - sets how many segments to XFADE

@uEXAMPLE:@u

  1. Goto Page 2 and load a sound
  2. Goto Page 4 and play the sound
  3. Press the LOOP button and 'draw' the LOOP on the
     PROFILE display
  4. play the sound with the new loop
  5. change the XFADE: to make the loop smoother
#6
@uZERO@u

TO DELETE or ZERO PROFILE(S)  TYPE:z)or	z/LIGHTPEN
delete profile from graph - D<return>0<DELETE>
set profile to zero value - Z<return>0<ZERO>
If a profile is OPEN for modification then it will be DELETED<or ZEROED accordingly.

If a HARMONIC BLOCK has been selected
by touching one of the selection boxes under each group of 8
harmonics then those 8 harmonic profiles will be DELETED or
ZEROED. Note that DELETE does not alter the value of a profile
but only removes it from the graph - ZERO sets the value of
the profile to zero for all segments.
  
#7
@uWAVETABLES@u

Waveforms instead of sinewaves can be used for additive
synthesis.

WAVETABLE voice lets you use waveform segments from another
VOICE be the source of sound.

Harmonic numbers become segment numbers of this VOICE.


To use WAVETABLES do the following:

  1. Click the mouse on the "WAVETABLE voice:" input. The
     COMMAND: will open with the 'WT,' waiting for you.
  2. Type a number from 0 to 8: n<return>
                          where n = voice number from 0-8
     Typing 0 will use existing SINE waves for harmonics.


The first 32 segments of specified voice are then used as
input waveforms:
  Segment 1 will be mapped to HARMONIC 1
  Segment 6 will be mapped to HARMONIC 6
  all the way to segment 32
#8
@uWAVETABLE THOUGHTS@u

Once complete you can use the new VOICE in different ways:

  MODE 1 - will cycle through the first 32 segments similar
           to the PPG synth

  MODE 3 - will play 2 seperate waveforn SEGMENTS allowing
           you to pick which segments and mix between them

  MODE 4 - will just play the sound but will also give you
           a loop for more fun.

  MODE 5 - although designed for multi-part sample playback
           MODE 5 can be used to play parts of the
           wavetable for added effects
