@uCONTROL PARAMETERS@u

The CONTROL PARAMETERS displayed on PAGE 7 are the heart of
QasarBeach. They control all the realtime things like PAN,
VOLUME, FILTER, Effects, etc. And can be selected, adjusted
and patched independently for each VOICE.

They are arranged in two middle tables.
The top relate exactly to Fairlight IIx.
The middle bottom are new additions giving access to DELAY,
STEREO mixing, Boosts, etc.

The bottom (boxed in) section show2 the current loaded
voices, patchable parameters like KEYVEL (velocity), KEYPAN
(panning), new LFO, Custom Functions and external controls.

New values may be assigned according to the TYPE of the
parameter CONTROL TYPE: Discretely variable, or "sliding".
May be assigned a number or patched to a CONTROL.
SWITCH TYPE: Two-state, or "on/off". May be set either
"ON" or "OFF", or patched to a SWITCH.

Click any PARAMETER and you can directly enter text at the
COMMAND line, or select the highlighted path from the lower
(boxed in) section.

Hovering over any lit PARAMETER allows you to change it by
using the mouse wheel or LEFT/RIGHT Keys.
#3
@uCONTROL INPUTS@u

After any CONTROL PARAMETER is a highlighted block with:
Controls that can be a value from 1 to 128
numbers: 1 to 128
alpha then numbers: CN01-64, FN01-09, LFO01-09
words: KEYVEL, KEYNUM, KEYPAN, AFTERT

Controls that can be on or off:
words: ON or OFF
alpha then numbers: SW01-64, LFO01-09

You will also see a lighter fader or checkmark to further
show you instantly what the value is.

@uTO SET A PARAMETER@u

First click the required PARAMETER and then click one of
the lower valid entries:
  LFO 2
  FUNCTION 1
  KEYVEL, etc.


KEYVEL, KEYNUM and KEYPAN come from both the midi keyboard
and also PAGE R sequences. They can be patched to any valid
CONTROL PARAMETER.
#4
@uKEYVEL, KEYNUM, KEYPAN, AFTERT@u

KEYVEL is key velocity, computed by the music keyboard for
each key that is played. The VOLUME control parameter can
be patched to the KEY VELOCITY function for touch control
of the voice's volume.


KEYNUM is similar in operation to KEYVEL, except that the
data controlling the effect is derived from the number of
that key from the left side of the music keyboard:
  Lowest C generates a KEYNUM of 0
  Highest C generates a KEYNUM of 96

KEYNUM data can be used for cross-fades between multi-voice
registers or to control filter response over the keyboard.


KEYPAN is the note pan information. It is not sent from a
MIDI keyboard, but comes from PAGE R. This allows you to
dynamically set the value of KEYPAN and use it to control
any parameters you want.


AFTERT is key atertouch. Only some MIDI keybords send this
data. Similar in operation to CONTRL patches, with the same
range, 1 to 128
#5
@uFUNCTIONS@u
User Defined are curves drawn on PAGE F and used in PAGE 7
letting you draw response curves for:
  KEYVEL: Key velocity
  KEYNUM: Key number
  AFTERT: Aftertouch
  KEYTIM: Key time (the time a key is being held down)
  CONTROL inputs
  LFO

Some examples:
  1. A control fader could be given an curved response,
     rather than linear.
  2. Cross fading a multi-voice by assigning inverted
     KEYNUM or keyboard control faders
  3. Touch sensitivity of MIDI keyboard can be varied.
  4. Timed functions like filter sweeps can be assigned.

Nine FUNCTIONs, 1 to 9, are possible per voice

To include a FUNCTION on PAGE 7, click the PARAMETER you
want and then the FUNCTION NUMBER. The PARAMETER should
then show FN0<x>
where:  x = the requred FUNCTION.

To edit a FUNCTION. Just click the required function or
goto PAGE F (see PAGE F HELP)
#6
LFO stands for Low Frequency Oscilator. Think of it as a
value that goes up and then down and repeats.

There are 9 LFOs per voice arranged in 3 banks of three:
  LFO1 to LFO3: go up and down smoothly
  LFO4 to LFO6: go up and down and hold their position
  LFO7 to LFO9: are random and hold their position

Each LFO has a range of values it goes from. MIN to MAX and
a SPEED. The lower the value of SPEED the slower it goes.

Both FUNCTIONS and LFOs give values from 1 to 128 and can be
pathced to most parameters.

@uEXAMPLES@u
To set a sound automatically PAN from left to right:
  1. Click the PAN PARAMETER
  2. Click LFO 1 NUMBER - you should see the PARAMETER
     change to LF01
  3. Adjust the MIN,MAX and SPEED levels for LFO1

To make a sound have a strange filter sweep:
  1. Click FILTER PARAMETER
  2. Click LFO 1 NUMBER
  3. Set LFO1 SPEED to 5
  4. Click RESONATOR PARAMETER
  5. Click LFO 2 NUMBER
  6. Set LFO2 SPEED to 8
#7
@uCONTROL FILES@u

This refers to the CONTROL PARAMETERS on PAGE 7 plus any
FUNCTIONS that have been defined.

These can be loads and saved individually or as a block of
voice data callen an INSTRUMENT.

A CONTROL FILE (.CO suffix) can be SAVED. By LOADING a file
all settings, patches and functions will be restored.
When loading a voice, the original CONTROL data is kept.

#:
@uMODE@u
range:  1,2,4,5
patch:  None
  Sets voice output style. There are 4 modes:
    1 - Plays a voice as a 32 segment wavetable synth
    2 - Plays a voice as a dual oscilator synth
    4 - Plays a voice as a smple with or without loop
    5 - Plays a voice as (up to) 16 voices

@uVOLUME@u
range:  1-128
patch:  CONTRL, KEYVEL, LF01
  This is the VOLUME control for the voice. Setting LEVEL
  to 1 will mute the voice completely.
  Note that this parameter may be patched to KEY VELOCITY
  for touch-sensitive control of voice dynamics.
  REAL-TIME COMPOSER - PAGE R, KEYBOARD SEQUENCER provides
  the ability to program KEY VELOCITY for individual notes.
  To use this facility VOLUME must be patched to KEYVEL on
  PAGE 7.

@uAUX VOLUME@u
range:  0-127
patch:  CONTRL
  This allows a secondary volume control. For example, if
  KEYVEL were patched to VOLUME, AUX VOLUME could control
  overall volume range of KEYVEL. Patching to functions
  allows cross fades between multi-voice registers.
#;
@uVOICE REF@u
range:  1 - 16
patch:  none
  Which voice is being played. It is possible to use the
  same voice data for multiple voices at the same time,
  thus allowing a synth to have a very small voice size,
  but many different sound, etc.

@uPAN@u
range:  1-64-128
patch:  LF01
  Stereo pan. All voices (even stereo ones) can be manually
  panned from their default center position (64).
    1 = hard left, 128 = hard right

@uPORTAMENTO@u
range:  ON,OFF
patch:  SWIT
  When ON, each channel allocated to the voice will produce
  a continuous portamento (glide) between each new pitch it
  is to play and the last pitch it played. The SPEED
  parameter determine how fast the rate of the glide.

@uSPEED@u
range:  0-127
patch:  CONTRL
  This is the SPEED control for PORTAMENTO functions.
    1  = slow time, 20 = fast time
#<
@uPITCHBEND@u
range:  0-128
patch:  CONTRL
  This shifts pitch of note being played.
  64 (the default) is the current note
  below 64 lowers the pitch of the note
  above 64 raises the pitch of the note

@uROOTNOTE@u
range:  1-64-128
  Modify the root note by a semitone
  64 (the default) is the current note
  below 64 lowers the semitone of the note
  above 64 raises the semitone of the note

@uTUNING@u
range:  1-64-128
  Modify tuning of a voice
  64 (the default) is the current note
  below 64 lowers the pitch of the note
  above 64 raises the pitch of the note
#=
@uMODE:2@u
@uSEGMENT A@u
range:  1 - 128
  The current SEGMENT being played. Think of this as a
  single oscillator in a traditional synth.

@uSEGMENT B@u
range:  1 - 128
patch:  CNTRL, LF01
  The second SEGMENT being played. This gives you 2
  oscillators playing at the same time. B can also be tuned
  from 64 (the current pitch) up and down an  octave.

@uA/B MIX@u
range:  1 - 128
patch:  LF01
  This is the MIX between the 2 oscilators A and B.
  1 = oscillator A, 128 = oscillator B. Anything in between
  will be a MIX of the 2.
  Start with A and B being the same and a MIX of 64. Now
  slowly TUNE B to get a range of effects.

@uB TUNE@u
range:  1-64-128
patch:  64
  This shitfs the B oscillator tuning from normal (64) up
  and down by 1 Octave. Very small increments will give
  flanging effects. 1 would be a sub oscillator.
#>
@uMODE:4@u
@uSTART SEG@u
range:  1 - 128
patch:  CTRL
  This control allows the STARTING SEGMENT of the voice to
  be modified; i.e., at what segment the voice will begin
  Note that by patching LOOP START and START SEG to the same
  KEYBOARD CONTROL, the two parameters can be modified in
  parallel (most effective in MODE 4).
  
@uLOOP CNTRL@u
range:  On/Off
pathc:  off
  Set this switch ON to use any of the LOOP CONTROL
  PARAMETERS. The LOOP consists of a start and end point.
  The range of segments which are played continuously for
  the duration of a key press or note length.

@uLOOP START@u
range:  1 - 128
patch:  29
  This allows you to specify the start SEGMENT number of
  the LOOP. By patching this parameter and LOOP END to
  KEYBOARD CONTROLS, precise adjustments can easily be
  made to the loop position. If assigned a numeric value,
  modification of loop on PAGE 4 will cause the assigned
  numbers to change accordingly.
#?  
@uLOOP END@u
range:  1 - 128
patch:  128
  This determines the end segment in the LOOP. If assigned
  a numeric value, modification of the loop on PAGE 4 will
  cause the assigned END to change accordingly.

@uX FADE@u
range:  1 - 128
patch:  20
  QasarBeach will automatically add a 1 SEGMENT cross-fade
  prevnting a looped sound from clicking. X-FADE work
  backwards from the LOOP START in SEGMENT, so If your LOOP
  START is 10 then use X-FADEs that are lower than 10,
  otherwise you will get strange results - which moght be
  what you want.
#@
@uMODE:5@u
This allows you to store up to 16 different samples in a
single voice. These can be spread across the keyboard and
each having a different root values.

To use MODE 5 you need to do the following:
  1. Load (or create) a voice with more than one sound
  2. Select MODE 5 - by default the show subvoices option
     will be set to NO, set this to YES to show the
     SUBVOICE allocation page
     Initially the voice will play all of it anywhere on
     the kayboard.
  3. Select a SUBVOICE - these are numbered 1 to 16 on the
     far right of the UI
  4. Click and draw the START and END of the voice to be
     played, either by drawing on the voice, or by entering
     the required numbers in START and END (can be found
     underneath SEGMENTS)
  5. Select the required range of keys to assign this
     SUBVOICE to. Or just select those notes you want to
     use. The SUBVOICE number should show ACTIVE next to it
  6. You can alter the ROOT note of this SUBVOICE to any
     note that sound correct to you by using the ROOT:
     PARAMETER
  7. Now select the second SUBVOICE, and repeat steps 4 - 6

It will take a few trys to get this right, but once you are
more familiar, you will get very fast results.
#A
@uFILTER@u
range:  1-127
patch: CONTRL, KEYNUM, LF01
  A LOW-PASS tracking filter. If set to 1 the filter is
  bypassed completely. Patch to KEYNUM allows custom
  filter response over the music keyboard.

@uENHANCE@u
range:  1 - 128
patch:  1, LF01, FN01
  This will ENHANCE the sound of the voice, making it sound
  loader and more harsh. Great for adding 'bite' back into
  dull drum sounds.

@uSTEREO@u
range:  1-64-128
patch:  64
  Adds a faux stereo to any sound. the default is 64 which
  is no stereo added. Moving further to 1 adds more left
  STEREO and moving further to 128 adds more right STEREO.
  Use with STEREO MIX to further add depth to any sound.

@uSTEREO MIX@u
range:  1 - 128
  This controls how much faux stereo to add to the mix. The
  default is 128 which is all faux STEREO. Lower the amount
  to make more subtle adjustments to the depth of the 
  STEREO effect.
#B  
@uBITZ CRUSH@u
range:  1 - 128
  Reduces output quality of voice making it sound more
  gritty and low-fi.

@uDELAY@u
range:  1 - 128    64       Add a delay to the voice
@uDELAY IN@u
range:  1 - 128    80       How much to add to the delay
@uDELAY OUT@u
range:  1 - 128    90       How much delay to mix
@uRELEASE ECHO@u
