For HELP, touch any BOX with LIGHTPEN or TYPE: n<set>(where: n = sheet no.
For HELP with HELP PAGES, press <add> key.>

A HELP PAGE accompanies each standard DISPLAY PAGE, with full
guidance for the use of the various features provided. A
"screen-full" of help is called a SHEET - each help page
consists of several of these sheets.>
A HELP INDEX is provided on the FIRST sheet of every help page
to allow quick access to HELP for major features in two ways:
1. BY TYPING the sheet number and pressing <set> key.9
2. BY TOUCHING an illuminated INDEX BOX with the LIGHTPEN
"Touch" means: point pen at item without touching tip
with finger then "trigger" by a quick touch on tip.
These INDEX BOXES are also provided throughout the HELP page.
Any word inside an illuminated box may be touched with the
lightpen for help on that topic.

See PREVIOUS SHEET BOX.TO CHANGE HELP SHEETSPRESS:
<add>keyTO: go forward to next sheet
<sub>go backward to preceding sheet
<set>go to 1st sheet (HELP INDEX)(sheet no.)
<set>go to any sheet;
e.g. 3<set><clear>  or  <return>return to DISPLAY PAGE
press <add> key for next sheet
TO CHANGE HELP SHEETS with LIGHTPEN five "touchable" boxes
are provided at the top of each sheet as well as the INDEX
BOXES placed around key words.

TOUCH:
<FWD> boxTO go forward to next sheet
<BWD> go backward to preceding sheet
<TOP> go to 1st sheet - HELP INDEX
<PRE> go to previous sheet
<PAGE x> return to DISPLAY PAGEa<INDEX BOX>
select sheet for illuminated word
THE PREVIOUS SHEET BOX:<PRE> is related to the illuminated INDEX
boxes found around key words. When an INDEX box is touched
with the lightpen, the sheet for that topic will be selected.
Touching <PRE> will then take you back to the original
(previous) sheet. In fact you can backtrack through consecutive
INDEX box touches in this way; each touch of <PRE> will take
you back one further previous sheet. Thus the HELP sheets can
be easily browsed with the LIGHTPEN without losing your place.

ALL COMMANDS provided by the DISPLAY PAGE shown at upper-left
may be typed WHILE the HELP page is selected. Simply type the
command as described by the HELP sheet.
You will exit back tothe display page automatically.

press <add> key for next sheet

CONCISE DESCRIPTIONS of what you are to TYPE or touch with
the LIGHTPEN to use the DISPLAY PAGES are presented with the
aid of a few symbolic conventions.
Special Keys are indicated with lower-case letters within
"<>" brackets: <return>,<set>,<add>,<sub>,<clear>,etc.
Lightpen Items are indicated with upper-case letters within
"<>" brackets: <FWD>,<BWD>,<TOP>,etc.
Items which are defined when typed are indicated with[
lower-case letters (see "n" & "s" in the following example).

COMMANDS tell the CMI to "do something". The <return> key is
always the last key typed.
Commands are described like this....

TO SELECT a HELP PAGE:
TYPE:2select HELP for current DISPLAY page  -  H<return>
select HELP for DISPLAY page (n)
Hn<return>select HELP for page (n), SHEET (s)   -  Hn,s<return>
where:  n  =  name (number or letter) of page: 1-9,D,Ls  =  sheet number4

EXAMPLES:
H2<return> Select PAGE 2 HELP (sheet 1)
HD,2<return> Select PAGE D HELP, sheet 2
This command may be given from either a DISPLAY or HELP page.

press <add> key for next sheet

ASSIGNMENTS change the values, or "settings" of variable9parameters.
The <set> key is usually the last key typed.
Assignments are described like this example from PAGE 3....

To SET MASTER PITCH use <arrow> keys or LIGHTPEN to TAB to PITCH
TYPE: n<set>#Cwhere: n  = desired tuning, 0 - 255
Because the value is a number we call this a NUMERIC assignment=
(as opposed to ALPHABETIC where the value is a word or name).
When making ANY NUMERIC ASSIGNMENT the <add> or <sub> keys can
be used instead of <set> to ADD or SUBTRACT the typed number
from the current value. The use of these keys is up to you
thus they are not often mentioned but are always available.

TABBING to an ITEM means to SELECT it for an assignment.
Thiscan be done with either the 4 <arrow> keys or LIGHTPEN.

4	ARROW KEYS:  Press necessary keys to move the CURSOR (illuminated box) to the desired item.)
LIGHTPEN:  Touch displayed value of item.
<THE COMMAND LINE is NOT CLEARED after a COMMAND ERROR or any
ASSIGNMENT. The NEXT key typed will automatically clear the
command line UNLESS it is one of the following keys:
<rubout> <arrow> <home> <add> <sub> <set>

press <add> key for next sheet

TO SELECT A DISPLAY PAGETYPE:
Pn<return> where:
n  =  fill in the number or letter of desired page.
*<return> =  the RETURN key/>

EXAMPLE:
P2<return> (select DISPLAY PAGE 2)
On PAGE 1 the LIGHTPEN may be used to select any other page by
touching the page name or title.  On other pages, touching the
word INDEX (at upper left) will re-select PAGE 1

TO SET USER NAME ON SYSTEM DISK
First, use <down-arrow> key to TAB (move illuminated cursor)
to USER NAME.

TYPE: up to 20 characters<set>where:
<set> = the SET key.

SYSTEM FUNCTION INDEX
The next sheet is a index of SYSTEM FUNCTIONS and the DISPLAY
PAGES on which they are provided.
Wherever a function isfound on more than one page,
parentheses indicate the HELP page(with the most comprehensive description.
