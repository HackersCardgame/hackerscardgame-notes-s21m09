 You can go to a sheet by clicking the highlighted TEXT
 or by typing the sheet number into the COMMAND:
#2
The @uWAVEFORM GRAPH@u displays one SEGMENT (128 points) of the
VOICE as an oscilloscope-like image.

Waveforms can be created or altered either by drawing on
the graph with the mouse or by assigning LEVELS to
individual waveform points.

The @uDISPLAY and FILL@u functions are exact opposites of each
other:

  1. The DISPLAY function refers to the moving of a waveform
     segment INTO the GRAPH

  2. the FILL function refers to the moving of the waveform
     displayed on the graph INTO a VOICE SEGMENT

This allows a segment to be displayed and then modified to
any degree without losing the original (which remains
unaltered) until the segment is filled with the waveform
displayed on the graph. Thus the graph is a kind of
scratch-pad for waveform development.

The features of PAGE 6 fall into two groups:
  1. those which directly modify the waveform memory of the
     voice
  2. those which change only the displayed waveform and
     thus require you to use the FILL command before the
     voice will actually be modified
#3
@uCURRENT SEGMENT@u

to select the current WAVEFORM SEGMENT click
CURRENT SEGMENT: the COMMAND: line will becoms active with
the S (segment) added for you

 TYPE:  n<set>
where:  n  =  segment number

Maximum usable segment numbers are:
  32 in MODE 1
  128 in MODE 4

Next To CURRENT SEGMENT is a vertical fader. This shows the
current SEGMENT you are viewint. It can be clicked to goto
a required segment.


Segments can also be stepped through automatically. The
controls for this is called Stepping and more information
can be found on the next page.
#4
@uSTEPPING@u

When viewing SEGMENTS, they can be cycled thought one after
another. This is called stepping.


@uSTART AND STOP@u

To begine stepping, click the START button. You should see
the display change and SEGMENT number and fader positions
change respectively.

To stop stepping, just click the STOP button.

You can also use <space> to start and stop the stepping.
This overides the usual <space operating playback of PAGE R
sequences.


@uSTEP RATE@u

The RATE or speed the stepping occurs is controlled though
the vertical fader next to STEP RATE:
  Lower is faster stepping
  Higher is slower

You can also use the COMMAND:
  SR,n - where n is a number from 1 to 255
#5
@uWAVEFORM DRAWING@u

TO CREATE or MODIFY a DISPLAYED WAVEFORM, just draw on the
WAVEFORM with the mouse.

Large flowing shapes are best drawn by selecting JOIN (see
JOIN/PLOT switch).

@bRemember, the waveform graph is a scratch pad!@b

The FILL command MUST be used to move whatever has been
drawn back into the VOICE (to be heard or saved).

  1. Select a SEGMENT
  2. Draw with the mouse
  3. Select FILL and play your creation.
  
To create or modify the DISPLAYED WAVEFORM without using
the mouse; Use POINT and LEVEL.

  - Point is a position from 1 to 128 in the waveform
  - Level is a number from -128 to 128

A good way to explore PAGE 6 is to put a VOICE into MODE 2
The current DISPLAYED SEGMENT is the one being played.
You can then select a new segment or use the mouse wheel to
goto new SEGMENTS.
#6
@uJOIN AND PLOT@u

The JOIN and PLOT buttons selects the way in which the
WAVEFORM GRAPH responds to drawing or assignment to LEVEL.

There are 128 points in the displayed waveform. Both the
level control and mouse work by setting the amplitudes of
single points. However, when JOIN is selected each
subsequent alteration will be JOINED to the last by a
straight line (the points between are set automatically).


If PLOT is selected, each point can be individually altered
without affecting the others.

  - JOIN is good for creating waveforms or large-scale
     alterations
  - PLOT is better for fine detail.

  
To SELECT JOIN or PLOT either press the respective button
or enter the following commands:
  TYPE:
         J<return> - to select JOIN
         P<return> - to select PLOT
#7
@uZERO@u

To ZERO the DISPLAYED WAVEFORM (clear the display), click
the ZERO button or activate the COMMAND: and
  TYPE:
         Z<return>    - ZERO the WAVEFROM DISPLAY

@bNote@b
  The Actual VOICE is NOT affected until the FILL command
  is used.


@uINVERT@u

To INVERT the DISPLAYED WAVEFORM, Click the INVERT button
or activate the COMMAND: and
  TYPE:
         I<return>- This will INVERT the PHASE of the
                     waveform displayed4

@bNote@b
  The Actual VOICE is NOT affected until the FILL command
  is used.
#8
@uTRADITIONAL WAVEFORM@u

To generate TRADITIONAL WAVEFORMS:
  TRIANGLE, RAMP or variable-width PULSE waveform

Click the desired waveshape image at the bottom of the
display with the mouse.

Alternatively, you can activate the COMMAND: and
  TYPE:
         TRI<return> - for TRIANGLE waveform
         SAW<return> - for SAWTOOTH waveform
         SQ<return>  -  for SQUARE waveform

@bNote@b
  The Actual VOICE is NOT affected until the FILL command
  is used.

@uPULSE WIDTH@u
To set PULSE WIDTH, click the % box next to the SQUAREWAVE
button. The COMMAND: will appear and you can type a number
from 1-99 or activate the COMMAND: and
  TYPE:
         N,n - where n is a number form 1 to 99

@bNote@b
  The Actual VOICE is NOT affected until the FILL command
  is used.
#9
@uSEGMENT SMOOTH@u

With SMOOTH: you can add a smoothing factor to the SEGMENT.
This will have the effect of softening the sound. This can
be very useful when using the ROUGH: factors.

You use, just click the SMOOTH: and enter a number from 
  0   - no smoothing
  255 - lots of smoothing

You can also uses the COMMAND:

  SM,<n>
          where n is a number from 0 to 255

@uSEGMENT ROUGH@u

With ROUGH: you can add a random rougness factor to the
SEGMENT. This will have make the waveform sound harsher.

You use, just click the ROUGH: and enter a number from 
  0   - no Roughness added
  255 - lots of Roughness

You can also uses the COMMAND:

  RO,<n>
          where n is a number from 0 to 255
