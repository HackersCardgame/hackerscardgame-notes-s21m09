@uVOICE WAVEFORM DISPLAY@u

VOICE WAVEFORM DISPLAY allows the entire WAVEFORM for
a voice to be displayed on the screen at once.

PAGE D is a purely visual page. The format of the display
has been designed to reveal as much as possible about the
voice waveform in a single glance.

The waveform display will show immediately whether the
SAMPLE RATE was appropriate for a pitched external source:
If SAMPLE RATE was appropriate (i.e., voice is in tune with
the system) waveform crests and troughs will proceed in
linear, orderly way along the display - varying little
in their position within each successive segment
If SAMPLE RATE was almost appropriate (i.e., voice is
slightly flat or sharp; a 1-segment LOOP produces a sudden
slight pitch shift) waveform crests and troughs will
"drift" laterally through the display. If this drift is
to the RIGHT then sample rate was too HIGH - if to the
LEFT then sample rate was too LOW.

If SAMPLE RATE was totally wrong then the display will
usually be a hopeless jumble.  The relationship of one
cycle of signal to each segment of waveform memory
necessary for correct tuning is also the relationship
required for a visually coherent display. Thus voices
that look good will inevitably sound good too.

@uFORMAT SELECTOR@u

FORMAT SELECTOR provides the choice of 3 display formats:

 (A) is "tilted" diagonally for a 3-dimensional effect.

 (B) is vertically aligned with the screen. The display
     resolution is greater and fine detail is more easily
     distinguished

 (C) is the traditional "start-end" view with stereo voices
     being shown on top of each other
     
To select a FORMAT Click <A>,<B> or <C> with Mouse.

The format may also be specified as part of the typed
DISPLAY command.

(when in page D, activate the command line and type)

@uEXAMPLES:@u

  DA - will show the WAVEFORM in 3d
  DB - will show the WAVEFROM flat
  DC - will show the entire WAVEFROM from left ot right
#4
@uEND SEGMENT SELECTOR@u

END SEGMENT SELECTOR indicates the SEGMENT number of the
last segment displayed. This can be 128, 64 or 32

To select END SEGMENT click desired number with the mouse

The END SEGMENT may also be specified as part of the typed
DISPLAY command.

(when in page D, activate the command line and type)

@uEXAMPLES:@u

  D,32   - will show the WAVEFORM to segment 32
  D,64   - will show the WAVEFORM to segment 64
  D,128  - will show the WAVEFORM to segment 128

  DA,128 - will show 3d WAVEFORM to segment 128
  DB,64  - will show flat WAVEFORM to segment 64
#5
@uSTEP SELECTOR@u

STEP SELECTOR determines the NUMBER of SEGMENTS skipped
between display traces.

Thus if STEP = 4 every fourth segment is displayed.

The STEP can be 1, 2, 4, or 8 within limits which are
automatically displayed depending on the FORMAT selected.

To select STEP click desired number with mouse

The STEP value may also be specified as part of the typed
DISPLAY command

(when in page D, activate the command line and type)

@uEXAMPLES:@u

  DA,128  - Display Format A, end seg = 128
  DB,32,1 - Display Format B, end seg = 32, step = 1
  D,64    - Display, end seg = 64
  D,,2    - Display, step = 2
  
The voice WAVEFORM is displayed with the selectedformat,
end segment and step

  D,64    - Display, end seg = 64
  D,,2    - Display, step = 2
