Create that waveform. so the story goes...

 You can go to a sheet by clicking the highlighted TEXT
 or by typing the sheet number into the COMMAND:
#2
@uHARMONIC AMPLITUDE FADERS@u

HARMONIC AMPLITUDE FADERS control the amplitudes of the 32
HARMONICS for individual WAVEFORM SEGMENTS. The Amplitude
levels can be seen both as a fader and a number.

The PROFILE GRAPH of PAGE 4 and the FADERS of PAGE 5 thus
have similar functions; in fact any change in harmonic
amplitudes on either of these pages will be reflected on
the other since both are dealing with the SAME harmonics.

Any loaded VOICE may be selected. PAGE 5 may be used in
and MODE.

TO SET a HARMONIC FADER, Click a fader at the requred
position (the fader should light up). A value then appears
beneath with an arrow.

You can also use the <arrow> keys when a fader is
lit up.

Or you can click the Number and the HM command will appear
in the COMMAND line ready to accept a number from 0-255.

  HM,<data> - to set the current fader
  HM,<fader>,<data> - to set a fader to the data value
  HM,<segment>,<fader>,data> - to set a fader in another
                               segment to the data value
#3
@uCURRENT SEGMENT@u

to select the current WAVEFORM SEGMENT click
CURRENTSEGMENT: the COMMAND: line will becoms active with
the S (segment) added for you

 TYPE:  n<set>
where:  n  =  segment number

Maximum usable segment numbers are:
  32 in MODE 1
  128 in MODE 4
  
The FADERS and WAVEFORM for the segment will be displayed.


@uZERO FADERS@u

To ZERO all the HARMONIC FADERS Click on the ZERO button
or activate the COMMAND: and

  TYPE:  HZ<return>
#4
@uWAVETABLES@u

Waveforms instead of sinewaves can be used for additive
synthesis.

WAVETABLE voice lets you use waveform segments from another
VOICE be the source of sound.

Harmonic numbers become segment numbers of this VOICE.


To use WAVETABLES do the following:

  1. Click the mouse on the "WAVETABLE voice:" input. The
     COMMAND: will open with the 'WT,' waiting for you.
  2. Type a number from 0 to 8: n<return>
                          where n = voice number from 0-8
     Typing 0 will use existing SINE waves for harmonics.


The first 32 segments of specified voice are then used as
input waveforms:
  Segment 1 will be mapped to HARMONIC 1
  Segment 6 will be mapped to HARMONIC 6
  all the way to segment 32
#5
@uWAVETABLE THOUGHTS@u

Once complete you can use the new VOICE in different ways:

  MODE 1 - will cycle through the first 32 segments similar
           to the PPG synth

  MODE 3 - will play 2 seperate waveforn SEGMENTS allowing
           you to pick which segments and mix between them

  MODE 4 - will just play the sound but will also give you
           a loop for more fun.

  MODE 5 - although designed for multi-part sample playback
           MODE 5 can be used to play parts of the
           wavetable for added effects
#6
@uWAVEFORM SMOOTH@u

With SMOOTH: you can add a smoothing factor to the waveform.
This will have the effect of softening the sound. This can
be very useful when using the ROUGH: factors.

You use, just click the SMOOTH: and enter a number from 
  0   - no smoothing
  255 - lots of smoothing

You can also uses the COMMAND:

  SM,<segment>,<n>
          where n is a number from 0 to 255

@uWAVEFORM ROUGH@u

With ROUGH: you can add a random rougness factor to the
waveform. This will have make the waveform sound harsher.

You use, just click the ROUGH: and enter a number from 
  0   - no Roughness added
  255 - lots of Roughness

You can also uses the COMMAND:

  RO,<segment>,<n>
          where n is a number from 0 to 255
#7
@uAUTO CLAMP@u

AUTO CLAMP can be set to OFF or ON.

When ON and a wavefrom is calculated, the result may excede
the available range. This is then clamped (prevented) from
making the sound hard and nasty.

When OFF and a wavefrom is calculated, any resulting values
outside the available range will not be corrected. You will
see the waveform do odd things and it will sound hard and
nasty. But this may be exactly what you want!
